# TwitterBot
Repository for storing Twitter bots I've decided to develop. All run through PythonAnywhere.com

EurobeatNamesBot can be found at @EurobotNames on Twitter, it uses the titles of existing Eurobeat Songs featured in the Initial D anime series to generate a new, random name every hour, then tweets it out.
